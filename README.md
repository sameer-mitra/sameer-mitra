I am a full stack Applications Developer, specialising in Microsoft technologies, with over 15 years experience in designing and developing enterprise software. I have a strong background in technologies like .NET, SQL Server, REST API, and more recently, AWS, React and ExtJS.

I get along easily with a variety of people and have worked well as part of teams as well as individually â€“ as a sole developer on projects. I have a proven track record of delivering, managing and maintaining software solutions across a broad range of industries.

When I am not working, I like to travel, and am getting back into sports after a hiatus ðŸ™‚
